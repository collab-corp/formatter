A php package for formatting data/values.

<p>
  It is pretty common to have to format/sanitize data to get it in the format we need it to be in. This package
  aims to make it easy to do so without having to dirty up your code with several function calls. If you are familiar with
  the Laravel framework, then the syntax should feel familiar. In fact, this package utilizes several support classes used in
  the Laravel framework.
